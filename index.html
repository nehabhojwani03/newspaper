            If you are been following the FIFA World Cup in Qatar closely you will of course know that
            starting Tuesday,
            November 29, there won't be any 3:30pm kick-off. Instead, the first two games of the
            day, which
            will
            both feature teams from the same group, will kick-off at 8:30 PM and the next two will start
            at
            12:30 AM and will
            again feature team from the same group.
        </section>
        <br>
        <section>
            According to the protocol that FIFA follows, the last two games of each group (3rd match for all
            4 teams in
            a group), or in other words the last round of matches across all 8 groups kick-off in this
            fashion. But
            have you ever wondered why this happens?
        </section>
        <br>
        <section>
            For the answer to that question we need to travel all the way back to the 1978 edition of
            the
            World Cup in
            Spain and to a match between West Germany and Austria, which picked up the nickname of
            <mark>'The disgrace
                of Gijon'.</mark>

            The two teams faced each other at the El Molinon stadium in Gijon, Spain on June 25, 1982. It
            was the
            last match of Group 2. The other two teams in the group - Algeria and Chile had played their
            last
            match the day before.Algeria were playing some very good football in what was their World Cup
            debut. They had already
            stunned the West Germans in their opening game.
        </section>
        <br>
        <section>
            And then after a loss to Austria, pulled off another win
            against Chile.
            The Algerians were in second position,behind Austria, with 4 points. So as things stood before
            the West
            Germany vs Austria match - an Austrian win or even a draw would ensure Algeria's progress to the
            next round.
        </section>
        <br>
        <section>
            Meanwhile, a West Germany win by 3 goals or more would see Algeria qualify along with the
            Germans. Also,
            importantly - the third scenario was a win by either one or two goals for West Germany would
            see the
            Germans and the Austrians go through at the expense of Algeria on goal difference.

        <section>
            And that's exactly the script that the two teams played out on the pitch.
            In what was one of the most shocking sights on a football pitch in the history of the World Cup,
            the Germans and the Austrians colluded to play the game in a way that Germany walked away with a
            1-0 win.

            The Germans scored the first goal inthe 12th minute via then centre-forward and current coach of
            <mark>Hamburger SV,
                Horst Hrubesch</mark>, nicknamed <mark>'The Header Beast' </mark>for his skills in heading
            the ball.But after this goal, both teams began to aimlessly pass the ball around in their own
            halves.
            No attacking
            plays as such were witnessed.
        </section>
        <br>
        <section>
            Often the ball was kicked back to the goal-keeper.Barring
            a couple of players
            who showed some intent, the match steadily deteriorated into quite the farce. The game ended
            at 1-0 to the
            Germans which meant that West Germany,Austria and Algeria all finished on 4 points and the
            Germans and the
            Austrians went through to the next round on goal difference. West Germany had a GD of +3,
            Austria of +2 and
            Algeria had a GD of 0.

        <section>
            The commentators were disgusted by what they witnessed, so were the fans in the stadium. Local
            newspaper El
            Comeercio ran the match report in its crime section. According to some reports, Austria's
            national
            broadcasters told viewers in Austria to switch off their TV sets.

            It appeared to be an on the spot decision by the teams to play in this fashion and not really
            pre-match
            fixing, but the match went down in the history books as one of the most infamous games of
            football ever
            played and is still remembered as <mark>'The disgrace of Gijon'.</mark>The Algerian Federation
            of course protested against this, but since no

            rules were broken, FIFA
            or any other
            body couldn't punish anybody.What FIFA did do though after this was revise its World Cup match
            schedule such that the final
            matches of
            all groups from the next edition in 1986 would have simultaneous kick-offs.This was done to
            maintain the
            sanctity of the games and the tournament as a whole, so that no team/teams can plan results in
            advance,

            based on previous results. It helps to maintain a level playing field for all team gets the
            short end of the
            stick. In the 1982 edition, West Germany made its way to the final, where they lost to eventual
            champions, Italy. Austria meanwhile were knocked out in the second round (played at that

            time before the knockouts
            which began with the semi-finals), after a 0-1 loss to France and a 2-2 draw with Northern Ireland.The
            practice of simultaneous kick-offs for the last two games of a group serves another purpose
            - that of
            ensuring that of ensuring that no match-fixing of any kind, propelled by by bets on a
            team/teams, can be
            engineered.
